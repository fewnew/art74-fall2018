Description: 
  I wanted to create something related to weather especially since I starter to get a liking for meteorology. Weather in general is the main
  inspiration of this piece. I used transitions, blur effects, zoom effect, color effect, and also the green screen. I really had a lot of fun
  creating this project. I have used After Effect before but I really havent been on it for quite a while. So this was a really great way to 
  show me that I should jump right back into it. I used to do more of AMV so this is something different from what im used to doing. I wanted 
  to give off a relaxing vibe to this video and how weather is able to change peoples emotions.
  
  I also wanted to show that there are alot more out there to life than just staying home inside. Most people would decide to stay inside while
  it rains. Thats when they start to miss out on mother nature true habitat. To me its trully beautiful when it rains. I like the smell, teh wind,
  the water splashing on the ground, and the grey cloudy skies. I like to be outside when it is raining. I never like to stay inside. Granted I do
 catch a cold at times but that still doesnt stop it from beinng my favorite climate. Im more used to cold weather anyways.
